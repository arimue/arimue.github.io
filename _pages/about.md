#Scientific Interest
The ever increasing possibilities of exploring the earth's surface by remote sensing methods fascinate me.  I am particularly interested in the potential of remote sensing for the analysis of natural hazards. Through a combination of remote sensing and field work I have been working on creating high-quality, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) through satellite photogrammetry. These serve as a basis for my research on debis flows in the NW Argentine Andes, a region that is frequently subjected to natural extreme events such as debris flows and landsliding.


#Current Projects
I am currently a PhD student at the University of Potsdam's [Remote Sensing and Earth-Surface Processes](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/) team.
